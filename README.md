# Matrix-Diagonal-Sums--Optimize
A problem that occasionally arises in numerical computing when working with Matrices (2D Arrays) is to compute the sums of the Diagonals of a matrix.

The purpose of this problem is to write sumdiag_OPTM() which is a faster version of the provided sumdiag_BASE() to calculate the sums of diagonals.several optimizations must be implemented and suggestions are given in a later section
